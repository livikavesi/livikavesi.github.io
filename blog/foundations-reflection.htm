                What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?
            </h3>
            <p>
                #1 I learnt being overconfident gets me into trouble. I would procrastinate then fall behind, from where
                i want to be. I need to always have my ego in check.
                <br />
                #2 Although I consider myself an introvert. I learnt that I can engage with others when I put my ego
                aside. Something great always comes out when I reach out of my comfort zone. Iv'e met some really cool
                people.
                <br />
                #3 I learnt I’m a great listener, however expressing my thoughts is something I need to work on more.

            <h3 class="question">
                What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?
            </h3>
            <p>
                For me, values are your drive, why we do what we do. My values for supporting my family is what helps me
                push forward. “He who has a why to live for can bare almost any how” – Friedrick Nietzsche. Empathy to
                me is like Karma, it’s what fuels our values. I need to understand and help others, because I understand
                that alone, I cannot make it to where I want to go. It is the generosity of others that I am able to
                learn how to code. “If you want to go fast go alone, if you want to go far go together” – anonymous.
                Self-awareness for me is the keys to our drive(growth). When we are aware of our strength and weakness,
                we know what to develop and improve on. We can exercise a growth mindset when in a challenging, learning
                environment. To finish off with my driving theme, a quote I like to abuse – “If you don’t know where
                you’ve been, how do you know where you going” :D

                What has surprised you the most about the core learning?
            </h3>
            <p>
                To me it is the fact that it is being taught and emphasize in our studies. It’s a real eye-opener that
                this is what the industry is looking for. I really enjoy practising looping, found it really helpful
                because my people skills need work on.

                What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?
            </h3>
            <p>
                For me it was putting myself out there, reaching out to classmate for looping. I would get anxious at
                first but it would always end up being a good conversation.

                Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web
                development Bootcamp course?
            </h3>
            <p>
                Because team work is important. You can teach someone how to code but its difficult to teach them how to
                be kind human. If you hire someone who is willing to learn and improve on him/her self. They are someone
                who’s easy to work with.

            <h3 class="question">
                Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used
                that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.
            </h3>
            <p>
                Personally, I enjoy learning how to programme more than the core challenges. However, I do recognize and
                understand the important of having these skills. Without proper human skills, having all the technical
                skills in the world is limiting in a team based projects. You might have the greatest idea ever but its
                near useless when you can’t express it.
