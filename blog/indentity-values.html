                    Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to
                    make. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that
                    decision, the decision you made, and the consequences of your
                    action?

                <p class="answer">
                    I recently got release from prison in March. Just after a year 
                    and half being inside, I had an opportunity to join a computer 
                    course called Take2. A course that has a mission to give people 
                    with a criminal history a second chance. We learnt how to code, 
                    practise soft skills, mindfulness and many other learning challenges. 
                    I knew this was the path I needed to take. Only a few weeks into the 
                    course, I had my parole hearing. The parole board suggested I do a 
                    three months Drug Treatment Programme (DTP), which means I will need 
                    to drop the Take2 programme.
                    <br />
                    Here was my dilemma. I do the DTP and get out earlier, or I continue 
                    in this one-year path with Take2. I wanted to get out sooner to help 
                    support my family, but it also meant returning to a work life I had 
                    no passion for. This would likely increase my chances of reoffending. 
                    Thinking about the long run and what was really best for my future. 
                    Against my family’s wish’s, I decided to endure another year and a 
                    half inside. After many heart aches, I got my freedom and become a 
                    Take2 graduate. I have no regrets because now I can see a prosperous 
                    future for myself and loved ones.

                    Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity?

                <p class="answer">
                    I find the term culture very strange. I resented the Samoan culture 
                    and traditions. I believed it was the reason for my hardships growing 
                    up. It felt like money was always going to the church and faalavelave’s 
                    (funerals/emergency), to people who genuinely didn’t care about us. 
                    However, I learnt from my parents what it means to be sincere. Being 
                    kind regardless of the outcome. I choose to adopt an identity that is 
                    adaptable, that takes in the positive core aspects of what it means to 
                    be a Samoan Kiwi. Respectful, humble, also true to self.

                    Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning

                <p class="answer">
                    My biggest strength is my attitude. Having a growth-mindset, 
                    being open-minded and not fearing failure, but viewing them 
                    as opportunities to learn and grow from. I enjoy challenges 
                    that help push me to become better individual and as a 
                    professional. My limitation will probably be my know how to 
                    fully utilise resources and what access I may have.

                    Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work
                    productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss
                    the strategies you used at that time, how effective they were, and your
                    reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why?
                </p>
                <p class="answer">
                    In my last job, I worked as the night shift team leader. There was
                    tension between night and day shift because we had a share target,
                    but we were constantly outperforming them. I reached out to the day
                    shift and ask how we can help them. Turns out the day shift team
                    leader was sabotaging the machines; he didn’t like his new 2IC who
                    was in charge of maintenance. I confronted him but he didn’t care
                    that our jobs were on the line. I like to adopt the strategy of not
                    focusing on things I can’t control, but things I can. So, I changed
                    my hours to overlap with both shift and told the 2IC to approach me
                    directing with any issues. Later I got promoted to supervisor and the
                    nightshift team leader got the sack. However, upon reflection, I never
                    really tried to help him understand the situation he was putting
                    everyone in. Next time I will acknowledge the core issues and help the
                    best way I can, so I put unnecessary stress on myself. I need to put
                    people first.
