        <h2>functions</h2>
        <div>
            <p>
                functions lets you group a series of statements together to perform 
                a specific task. If different parts of a script repeats the same task, 
                you can reuse the function rather than repeating the same set of statements. 
            </p>
            <p>
                statements in a fuction arent always executed when a page load, so functions 
                also offer a way to store the steps needed to achieve a task. Script can ask 
                the function to perform all of those steps as and when they are required. 
                You might have a task that you only want to perform if user clicks 
                on a specific element in the page. Example  - 'Add to Cart' 'Buy Now' or 'Start Game'.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you are going to ask the function to perform its task later, you need to give 
                the function a name. That name should describe the task it is performing. When 
                you ask it to perform its task, its known as 'Calling' the function.
            </p>
            <p>
                the steps that the function needs to perform its task are packaged up in a code 
                block. A code block consist of one or more statements contained within curly 
                brackets {...}. 
            </p>
            <h3>Declaring a function</h3>
            <p>
                To crate a function, give it a name than write the statements needed to achieve 
                its task inside the curly brackets.
            </p>
            <code>
                function sayHello() { <br />
                    <span class="indent">
                        document.write("hello") <br />
                    </span> 
                }
            </code>
            <p>
                function = function keyword; <br />
                sayHello() = function name/Identifier<br />
                { document.write('Hello') } = Code Block(in curly brackets) with one statement
