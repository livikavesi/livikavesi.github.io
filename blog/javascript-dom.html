        <h2>JavaScript and its relationship to HTML and CSS.</h2>
        <div>
            <p>
                HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are often called the building blocks of the Web.
                HTML and CSS control the content and styling of a page, while JavaScript 
                is used to make it interactive.
            </p>
            <div class="flex-center">
                <img id="code-icon" src="/images/placeholders/coding-lang-icons.png" />
            </div>
            <p>
                HTML helps you structure your page into elements such as paragraphs, sections, 
                headings, navigation bars, and so on
            </p>
            <p>
                CSS improves the appearance of a web page. By adding thoughtful styles, you 
                make your page more attractive and pleasant for the end user to view and use.
                You can also use CSS to layout elements by positioning them in specified areas 
                of your page.
            </p>
            <p>
                HTML is the markup language and CSS is the design language, then JavaScript is 
                the programming language. You can program actions, conditions, calculations, 
                network requests, concurrent tasks and many other kinds of instructions. 
            </p>
            <div>
                <div class="flex-center">
                    <div id="car-html" class="example-car">
                        <p class="car-text">HTML</p>
                    </div>
                    <div id="car-css" class="example-car">
                        <p class="car-text">CSS</p>
                    </div>
                    <div id="car-js" class="example-car">
                        <p class="car-text">JAVASCRIPT</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <p>
                    Example - HTML is the body of a car, CSS is the paint job and the JavaScript is 
                    all the wires/parts connecting the cars buttons, gears, ignition etc. When you 
                    beep the horn it triggers a loud sound. When you turn the key the engine roars. 
                    When you turn the steering wheel the car turns.      
                </p>

            <h2>Control Flow</h2>
            <div>
                <p>
                    Control flow is a technical term in JavaScript. It is how the computer runs code 
                    from top to bottom. It is similar to how we read a book, line by line. There are 
                    statement that changes the control flow of the program such as loops, conditionals, 
                    or functions. 
                </p>

            <h2>Loops</h2>
            <div>
                <p>
                    Loops are a way to execute the same code block a specific number of times. Its like 
                    reading the same paragraph over and over consecutively. This can be helpful in many 
                    ways. In the example you might understand the content of the paragraph more each read 
                    through. In coding, looping can add value or information to other codes automatically 
                    instead of inputting them manually.

        <h2> Accessing data in Arrays vs Objects.</h2>
        <div>
            <p>
                Arrays are considered objects too but only in JavaScript. Array store data in an ordered 
                collection which can be accessed by using a numerical index. 
            </p>

            </p>
            <p>
                Objects are best use to represent real world things like cars, houses, people. Each object 
                contains properties that is access through a name / value pair method. 
            </p>

        <h2>Document Object Model (DOM)</h2>
        <div>
            <p>
                The DOM is an interface that allows programmers access to a web page documents. By 
                using JavaScript developers can update the content, structure, and style of their 
                web page. When you first load a web page. Your browser create what is called the DOM 
                Tree and each instances or nodes can be describe as objects. Each object contains 
                property you can get or set by using JavaScript methods.             
            </p>
            <div class="flex-center">
                <div id="dom-tree">

        <h2>Functions</h2>
        <div>
            <div class="flex-center">
                <p>
                    Functions lets you group a series of statements together to perform 
                    a specific task. If different parts of a script repeats the same task, 
                    you can reuse the function rather than repeating the same set of statements. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Statements in a function arent always executed when a page load, so functions 
                    also offer a way to store the steps needed to achieve a task. Script can ask 
                    the function to perform all of those steps as and when they are required. 
                    You might have a task that you only want to perform if user clicks 
                    on a specific element in the page. Example  - 'Add to Cart' 'Buy Now' or 'Start Game'.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="flex-center">
                <p>
                    If you are going to ask the function to perform its task later, you need to give 
                    the function a name. That name should describe the task it is performing. When 
                    you ask it to perform its task, its known as 'Calling' the function.
                </p>
                <p>
                    the steps that the function needs to perform its task are packaged up in a code 
                    block. A code block consist of one or more statements contained within curly 
                    brackets {...}. 
                </div>
            </p>
            <h3>Declaring a function</h3>
            <p>
                To crate a function, give it a name than write the statements needed to achieve 
                its task inside the curly brackets.
            </p>

            <p>
                function = function keyword; <br />
                sayHello() = function name/Identifier<br />
                { document.write('Hello') } = Code Block(in curly brackets) with one statement
