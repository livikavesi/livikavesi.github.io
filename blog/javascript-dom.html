        <h2>JavaScript and its relationship to HTML and CSS.</h2>
        <div>
            <p>
                HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are often called the building blocks of the Web.
                HTML and CSS control the content and styling of a page, while JavaScript 
                is used to make it interactive.
            </p>
            <p>
                HTML helps you structure your page into elements such as paragraphs, sections, 
                headings, navigation bars, and so on
            </p>
            <p>
                CSS improves the appearance of a web page. By adding thoughtful styles, you 
                make your page more attractive and pleasant for the end user to view and use.
                You can also use CSS to layout elements by positioning them in specified areas 
                of your page.
            </p>
            <p>
                HTML is the markup language and CSS is the design language, then JavaScript is 
                the programming language. You can program actions, conditions, calculations, 
                network requests, concurrent tasks and many other kinds of instructions. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Example - HTML is the body of a car, CSS is the paint job and the JavaScript is 
                all the wires/parts connecting the cars buttons, gears, ignition etc. When you 
                beep the horn it triggers a loud sound. When you turn the key the engine roars. 
                When you turn the steering wheel the car turns.

        <h2>Control Flow</h2>
        <div>
            <p>
                Control flow is a technical term in JavaScript. It is how the computer runs code 
                from top to bottom. It is similar to how we read a book, line by line. There are 
                statement that changes the control flow of the program such as loops, conditionals, 
                or functions. 
            </p>
        </div>
        <h2>Loops</h2>
        <div>
            <p>
                Loops are a way to execute the same code block a specific number of times. Its like 
                reading the same paragraph over and over consecutively. This can be helpful in many 
                ways. In the example you might understand the content of the paragraph more each read 
                through. In coding, looping can add value or information to other codes automatically 
                instead of inputting them manually. 
            </p>
        </div>

        <h2>functions</h2>
        <div>
            <p>
                functions lets you group a series of statements together to perform 
                a specific task. If different parts of a script repeats the same task, 
                you can reuse the function rather than repeating the same set of statements. 
            </p>
            <p>
                statements in a fuction arent always executed when a page load, so functions 
                also offer a way to store the steps needed to achieve a task. Script can ask 
                the function to perform all of those steps as and when they are required. 
                You might have a task that you only want to perform if user clicks 
                on a specific element in the page. Example  - 'Add to Cart' 'Buy Now' or 'Start Game'.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you are going to ask the function to perform its task later, you need to give 
                the function a name. That name should describe the task it is performing. When 
                you ask it to perform its task, its known as 'Calling' the function.
            </p>
            <p>
                the steps that the function needs to perform its task are packaged up in a code 
                block. A code block consist of one or more statements contained within curly 
                brackets {...}. 
            </p>
            <h3>Declaring a function</h3>
            <p>
                To crate a function, give it a name than write the statements needed to achieve 
                its task inside the curly brackets.
            </p>
            <code>
                function sayHello() { <br />
                    <span class="indent">
                        document.write("hello") <br />
                    </span> 
                }
            </code>
            <p>
                function = function keyword; <br />
                sayHello() = function name/Identifier<br />
                { document.write('Hello') } = Code Block(in curly brackets) with one statement
            </p>
