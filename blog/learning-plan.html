                    It seems unrealistic but why not shoot for the stars.
                    First my focus is on establishing a career as a software
                    developer, specifically in the gaming industry. Learn
                    what I can then pivot to creating my own business. Become
                    a multi business owner / investor then Bobs your uncle
                    I’m a billionaire.

                <p class="answers">My desires stem from wanting to be in a position to always
                    be able to help others. All great intentions and ideas are
                    wasted without resources. I want to give back to everyone,
                    to my family, friends and communities’ that are trying to
                    change the world for the better.

                <p class="answers">
                    I need to become better at self-management and coordinating
                    others. Mesh well in a team environment. Improve on my
                    people skills, become an effective communicator and leader.
                    Recognize my weaknesses and work on them. Stay open-minded
                    an always be willing to accept criticism to grow from.
                    Ultimately remember I can’t do it alone.

                        (Preferably ‘Metia Interactives’). Also I want to get into
