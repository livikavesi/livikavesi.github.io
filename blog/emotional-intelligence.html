            What is Emotional Intelligence?
        </p>
        <p class="cultural-blog-answer">
            Emotional intelligence (otherwise known as emotional quotient or EQ) 
            is the ability to understand, use, and manage your own emotions in 
            positive ways to relieve stress, communicate effectively, empathize 
            with others, overcome challenges and defuse conflict.

            How is it different to IQ?
        </p>
        <p class="cultural-blog-answer">
            IQ tests measure your ability to solve problems, use logic, and grasp 
            or communicate complex ideas. EQ tests measure your ability to recognize 
            emotion in yourself and others, and to use that awareness to guide your 
            decisions.

            Why is it important?
        </p>
        <p class="cultural-blog-answer">
            Emotionally intelligent people are better equipped to deal with negative 
            emotions that might be disruptive. EQ separates good performers in the 
            workplace from the great ones. It affects how we manage behavior, navigate 
            social complexities, and make personal decisions that achieve positive 
            results. Therefore, people with strong emotional intelligence are more 
            likely to succeed than those with high IQs or relevant experience.
