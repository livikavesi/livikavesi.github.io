                Not so long ago, many scientists believed that the brain did not change
                after childhood. That it was hard-wired, and fixed by the time we became
                adults. But recent advances in only the last decade now tell us that this
                is simply not true. The brain can, and does change throughout our lives:
                It is adaptable, like plastic hence neuroscientists call this
                'Neuroplasticity'.

            <h3>How does neuroplasticity work?</h3>
            <p>
                If you think of your brain as a dynamic, connected power grid. There are
                billions of pathways or roads, lighting up every time you think, feel
                or do something. Some of these roads are well travelled: These are our
                habits, our established ways of thinking, feeling and doing. Every time
                we think in a certain way. Practice a particular task or feel a specific
                emotion, we strengthen this road. It becomes easier for our brains to
                travel this pathway.
            </p>
            <p>
                Say we think about something differently, learn a
                new task, or choose a different emotion. We start carving out a new road.
                If we keep travelling that road our brains begin to use this pathway more,
                and this new way of thinking, feeling, or doing becomes second nature. The
                old pathway gets used less and less and weakens. This process of rewiring
                your brain by forming new connections and weakening old ones, is 'Neuroplasticity'
                in action. The good news is that we all have the ability to learn and change,
                by rewiring our brains. If you have ever changed a bad habit, or thought about
                something differently, you have carved a new pathway in your brain and
                experienced neuroplasticity firsthand. With repeated and directed attention
                towards your desired change you can rewire your brain
