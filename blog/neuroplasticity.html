        <h1>Neuroplasticity</h1>
        <div>
            <p>
                Neuroplasticity I would say is more commonly known as muscle memory.
                Let’s say you are doing weight training. The more repetition you do
                the easier it gets in time. The muscle doesn’t actually remembers,
                your brain does by connecting and lighting up certain neuro pathways.
                Each time you do the same exercise, the same neuro pathway is lit.
                The more repetition the stronger these neuro pathways get. Yes, the
                muscle gets stronger but only because the brain is getting more
                efficient, and more adept at using these pathways to send singles to
                the muscle and the rest of the body.
            </p>
            <h2>Mindset</h2>
            <p>
                These neurons don’t just store weight lifting information. It stores
                everything from your personality, emotions, memories etc. Which means,
                just like our muscles, our mental and emotional capability can get
                stronger also. Lets talk about our learning mindset.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Mindset” written by Ph.D. Psychologist Carol S Dweck. The book talks
                about two different mindsets people have. Growth-mindset and
                Fix-mindset. A growth-mindset person believes new skills can be acquired
                through hard work, while a fix-mindset believes that abilities are
                limited. When we face a challenging situation, like a difficult code
                exercise or presenting to an audience. Do my inner thoughts help me
                push through this obstacle or does it tell me its beyond my capabilities.

            </p>
            <p>
                Having these mindsets has a physical effect on the brain. Our brain
                changes, adapt based on our habits and beliefs. This is ‘Neuoplasticity’.

            <!-- <h3>Mindset story</h3>
            <p>
                I have an introverted personality, thankfully my sister and friends got 
                me into performing arts. It was just my pass time where I enjoy the 
                competitive games, being creative and making new friends. I didn’t find 
                meeting crunch time and the anxiety before going on stage pleasant at 
                all. After every show, the most outstanding individual/performance is 
                recognized through an award called “Massivest”. The usual talented person 
                would get it. New people would join and receive this award 
                yet I was the only senior member 
                without one. I felt like my skills will never measure up to their talents. 
                In one showing, our director decided the theme will be about ‘Super Heros’, 
                my favourite childhood subject. After years being in the ensemble, 
                to my surprise I finally earned the “Massivest” award. A regular audience 
                member complimented me after that show. “It’s been a great pleasure 
                watching you grow”. I carry these words with me with everything I do. 
            </p>
            <h2>Fix-Mindset versus Growth-Mindset</h2>
            <p>
                Having a fix-mindset isn’t bad. You don’t need to have a growth mindset 
                in areas you don’t find pleasure in. Example is some people don’t like 
                coriander or heavy metal music or abstract art. You don’t need to force 
                yourself to like or understand the people who do. The time you need a 
                growth-mindset the most is when you recognized it will help you grow and 
                achieve your goals. Example is I don’t like exercise but I ‘will’ do it. 
                I don’t enjoy writing blogs but I ‘will’ do it. I just want to focus on 
                coding but I ‘will’ do the core/people skills challenges.

                Not so long ago, many scientists believed that the brain did not change
                after childhood. That it was hard-wired, and fixed by the time we became
                adults. But recent advances in only the last decade now tell us that this
                is simply not true. The brain can, and does change throughout our lives:
                It is adaptable, like plastic hence neuroscientists call this
                'Neuroplasticity'.
            </p> -->
            <!-- <h3>How does neuroplasticity work?</h3>
            <p>
                If you think of your brain as a dynamic, connected power grid. There are
                billions of pathways or roads, lighting up every time you think, feel
                or do something. Some of these roads are well travelled: These are our
                habits, our established ways of thinking, feeling and doing. Every time
                we think in a certain way. Practice a particular task or feel a specific
                emotion, we strengthen this road. It becomes easier for our brains to
                travel this pathway.
            </p>
            <p>
                Say we think about something differently, learn a
                new task, or choose a different emotion. We start carving out a new road.
                If we keep travelling that road our brains begin to use this pathway more,
                and this new way of thinking, feeling, or doing becomes second nature. The
                old pathway gets used less and less and weakens. This process of rewiring
                your brain by forming new connections and weakening old ones, is 'Neuroplasticity'
                in action. The good news is that we all have the ability to learn and change,
                by rewiring our brains. If you have ever changed a bad habit, or thought about
                something differently, you have carved a new pathway in your brain and
                experienced neuroplasticity firsthand. With repeated and directed attention
                towards your desired change you can rewire your brain
