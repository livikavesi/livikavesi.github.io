            <h3>A time I was blocked by a simple problem:</h3>
            <p>
                The one time I felt really blocked was during the JavaScript Olympics 
                challenge. After hours of using my usual problem-solving methods, and 
                feeling mentally exhausted. I finally reached out for help on discord. 
                I kept getting the same error (see photo). Turns out I was using the 
                filter method wrong.
            </p>
            <p>
                Thanks to the help of a classmate, I learnt how to use the filter 
                method better. I treated the filter method like a map method. Instead 
                of writing a ‘if statement’ I needed to just pass through a conditional 
                value.
            </p>
            <p>
                It was a huge relief passing this test.

            <h2>A time I elegantly solved a problem:</h2>
            <p>
                There is a classic programming exercise called ‘FizzBuzz’. In a sequence 
                of numbers, you replace every multiple of 3 with 'Fizz', every multiple 
                of 5 with 'Buzz'. But for multiples of both 3 and 5, you replace with 
                'FizzBuzz'. The twist challenge (‘Super-FizzBuzz’) was having to do it 
                while the numbers were in an array. To solve this challenge, I needed to 
                read through the testing criteria and console log all the inputs which 
                tell me the output. If the output didn’t match the testing criteria or 
                what I was expecting. I had to go research if I was using the right method. 
                It took me around three hours but eventually I got there. The feeling when 
                you crack the code is just pure bliss. For me research is key.

            <h2>Confidence in problem solving techniques</h2>
            <div>
                <h3>Pseudocode</h3>
                <p>
                    I use this method when I try to understand a code I didn’t write. 
                    It helps to understand what the person thought process when he/she 
                    wrote the code, and handy when trying to remember what that peace 
                    of code does.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Trying something</h3>
                <p>
                    This method is my first instinct. I like to test myself before 
                    using other problem solving avenue’s. Exploring is something I 
                    enjoy doing.
                </p>

            <div>
                <h3>Rubber ducky method</h3>
                <p>
                    This method for me goes hand in hand with Pseudocode. I use this 
                    when I go to edit code that was originally not mine. I get a 
                    clearer picture of what im trying to achieve. 
                </p>

            <div>
                <h3>Reading error messages</h3>
                <p>
                    This is a skill I lack in most. I can read an error and the line it 
                    accrued in. But writing one makes me feel counterintuitive, while 
                    reading a custom one can sometimes get me flustered. 
                </p>

            <div>
                <h3>Console.logging</h3>
                <p>
                    Console logging is second nature to me. I always use it to check a 
                    value is what I expected.

                <h3>Googling</h3>
                <p>
                    Google is my best friend. After giving it ago and not succeeding, 
                    i would find majority of my answers online, I also use google a 
                    lot to remember certain syntax. 
                </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Asking your peers for help</h3>
                <p>
                    When I can’t seem to resolve a problem, for a very long period of 
                    time. This method is my second to last resort. It might be a pride 
                    thing, I’m not sure. I have no problem asking for help, I just have 
                    a problem with admitting defeat to a challenge. I just have a “never 
                    fold” attitude plus love the rush of overcoming a problem.
                </p>

            <div>
                <h3>Asking coaches for help</h3>
                <p>
                    As the last resort, after none of my peers are able to help, I don’t 
                    hesitate to ask the facilitators for help. I’ve yet to reach this 
                    stage because so far my peers have been great when I was stuck.

                <h3>Improving your process with reflection</h3>
                <p>
                    I’m quite confident in this space. My moto is “don’t make the same 
                    mistake twice”.
