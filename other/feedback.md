### Identity and Values

Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, and the consequences of your action?

I recently got release from prison in March. Just after a year and half being inside, I had an opportunity to join a computer course called Take2. A course that has a mission to give people with a criminal history a second chance. We learnt how to code, practise soft skills, mindfulness and many other learning challenges. I knew this was the path I needed to take. Only a few weeks into the course, I had my parole hearing. The parole board suggested I do a three months Drug Treatment Programme (DTP), which means I will need to drop the Take2 programme.

Here was my dilemma. I do the DTP and get out earlier, or I continue in this one-year path with Take2. I wanted to get out sooner to help support my family, but it also meant returning to a work life I had no passion for. This would likely increase my chances of reoffending. Thinking about the long run and what was really best for my future. Against my family’s wish’s, I decided to endure another year and a half inside. After many heart aches, I got my freedom and become a Take2 graduate. I have no regrets because now I can see a prosperous future for myself and loved ones.


### Depending on who your potential audience is you would write to their needs e.g. for someone who has no knowledge or understanding you may consider writing in full meaning with no abbreviations like rehab and assumptions.
### Any numbers between 1-9 you must write the entire word
### Hint: When answering a question someone may give you it pays to utilise their words in the question asked to show your understanding
### Shortening your sentences also so that there are no run-ons 

Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity?

I find the term culture very strange. I resented the Samoan culture and traditions. I believed it was the reason for my hardships growing up. It felt like money was always going to the church and faalavelave’s (funerals/emergency), to people who genuinely didn’t care about us. However, I learnt from my parents what it means to be sincere. Being kind regardless of the outcome. I choose to adopt an identity that is adaptable, that takes in the positive core aspects of what it means to be a Samoan Kiwi. Respectful, humble, also true to self.

### ‘Hated’ is a strong word so may consider a different word?
### ‘Stuff’? New word

Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development?

My biggest strength is my growth-mindset attitude. I won’t be afraid of failing, I enjoy learning and challenges that help push me to become a developer. My limitation will probably be my know how to fully utilise resources and what access I may have..

Maybe a bit more thinking into your learnings

Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss the strategies you used at that time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why?

In my last job, I worked as the night shift team leader. There was tension between night and day shift because we had a share target, but we were constantly outperforming them. I reached out to the day shift and ask how we can help them. Turns out the day shift team leader was sabotaging the machines; he didn’t like his new 2IC who was in charge of maintenance. I confronted him but he didn’t care that our jobs were on the line. I like to adopt the strategy of not focusing on things I can’t control, but things I can. So, I changed my hours to overlap with both shift and told the 2IC to approach me directing with any issues. Later I got promoted to supervisor and the nightshift team leader got the sack. However, upon reflection, I never really tried to help him understand the situation he was putting everyone in. Next time I will acknowledge the core issues and help the best way I can, so I put unnecessary stress on myself. I need to put people first.
