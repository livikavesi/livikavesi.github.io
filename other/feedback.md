### Identity and Values

Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, and the consequences of your action?

I am a Take2 student, anyone who is familiar with this programme would know that the students have done time. During my time, I had the choice to do a 3month rehab course suggested by the parole board, which meant early release. Or join the 1year Take2 computer course (a year inside 2 years outside). I wanted to get out early to help support my family, but it also meant I will be returning to a work life I had no passion for. I would likely end up back inside if I didn't try change the path I was on. So, I chose to stick it through and make the best of my situation. After a lot of heart aches, I got my freedom and graduated. I have no regrets, because now I can see a brighter future for myself and more importantly, for the people I care about.

Depending on who your potential audience is you would write to their needs e.g. for someone who has no knowledge or understanding you may consider writing in full meaning with no abbreviations like rehab and assumptions.
Any numbers between 1-9 you must write the entire word
Hint: When answering a question someone may give you it pays to utilise their words in the question asked to show your understanding
Shortening your sentences also so that there are no run-ons 

Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity?

In regards to culture, I find it very strange. I grew up being called a plastic Samoan. I hated the cultural stuff because I believed it was the reason for my hardships. It felt like money was always going to the church and faalavelave’s (funerals/emergency) to people who don’t really care about us. However I learnt from my parents what it means to be sincere. Being kind regardless of the outcome. I choose to adopt an identity that is adaptable, that takes in the positive core aspects of what it means to be a Samoan Kiwi. Respectful, humble, true to self.

‘Hated’ is a strong word so may consider a different word?
‘Stuff’? New word

Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development?

My biggest strength is my growth-mindset attitude. I won’t be afraid of failing, I enjoy learning and challenges that help push me to become a developer. My limitation will probably be my know how to fully utilise resources and what access I may have..

Maybe a bit more thinking into your learnings

Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss the strategies you used at that time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why?

In my last job, I worked as the night shift team leader. There was tension between night and day shift because we had a share target, but we were constantly outperforming them. I reached out to the day shift and ask how we can help them. Turns out the day shift team leader was sabotaging the machines; he didn’t like his new 2IC who was in charge of maintenance. I confronted him but he didn’t care that our jobs were on the line. I like to adopt the strategy of not focusing on things I can’t control, but things I can. So, I changed my hours to overlap with both shift and told the 2IC to approach me directing with any issues. Later I got promoted to supervisor and the nightshift team leader got the sack. However, upon reflection, I never really tried to help him understand the situation he was putting everyone in. Next time I will acknowledge the core issues and help the best way I can, so I put unnecessary stress on myself. I need to put people first.
